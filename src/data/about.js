        answer: "I've just finished the first version of my Evening Routine App ðŸŒœ, where the biggest challenges have been so far to get to understand Material-UI which I'm using. I've also used Dialogs, nested components and more advanced React techniques, where I've learnt a lot from."

        question: 'What are your future plans?',
        answer: "There are so many opportunities to keep up the good work - I would love to contribute on some COVID-19 apps to help building transparency in these hard times we are all facing right now. ðŸ˜· What I would also like is to continue working on my Evening routine app, where I need to implement some bug fixes for the frontend first. After that I would like to implement a backend to actually save data and persist evening routines. ðŸ§ "
